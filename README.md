# Project: Adult Census Income Prediction



# Abstract: 
This data was extracted from the 1994 Census bureau database by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker (Data Mining and Visualization, Silicon Graphics). A set of reasonably clean records was extracted. Certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out whether the income of the person is greater than or less than $50,000. Using this model we will get insights as well as we get to determine the income group.



# Problem Statement:
The Goal is to predict whether a person has an income of more than 50K a year or not.
This is basically a binary classification problem where a person is classified into the >50K group or <=50K group.



# Approach:
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.
